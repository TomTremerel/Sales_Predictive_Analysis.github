Hi there!

This project aims to predict the sales of the different Walmart supermarkets throughout the USA. The prediction is based on various variables such as fuel price, CPI (Consumer Price Index), temperature, holidays, and unemployment.

The dataset has already been cleaned; I made no changes except for converting the temperature into Celsius.
